## Extension configuration
You can configure the shipping notice either to be displayed after every price directly or in the footer whereas there ist an asterisk (*) behind every price referencing to the footer.

You can also define the tax and shipping text being dispayed. Therefore you can use %s in order to define the tax amount in the text.   
For defining the link to the shipping page you can use [ and ] before and after the word you want to use as a link.   
**Example**: Inkl. %s MwSt., zzgl. [Versand] will lead to Inkl. 19% MwSt., zzgl. Versand whereas Versand is the link to the shipping page.  
The last configuration setting is the selected cms page which is the shipping page you want to link to.

## Installed CMS Pages
